# Chatbot Development Exercise

**Test assignment (chatbot development)**

Create a conversational (don't confuse with transactional) chatbot that can answer the following questions:

- What is the current weather. Question examples:
  - What is the weather like in Madrid tomorrow?
  - Is it warm in Berlin after tomorrow?
  - Is wind expected in London today?
- Send an audio file and ask the chatbot to transcribe the content.

The response should be human-readable.

You might want to use the following technologies: OpenAI API, LangChain, Telegram API, Whisper (a model for transcribing). You are not limited to any of the mentioned technologies and you can use anyone you want or are proficient in.

## How to Run

1. Set up the environment by running:

```bash
chmod +x pre-install.sh
./pre-install.sh
```
2. Run the chatbot using the following command:
```
python3 main.py
```
